         #END
#for this sample...the next statement appears on the same line as the previous one since we only added a tab ie '\t'
print("Good morning", end="\t") #end specifies whether the next printed statement(string or whatever data type)
#                                will begin on a new line or stay on the same line
print("You know I love you, right?")

# For this example, the next statement appears on the next line as in default setting of end
print("hello brother", end="\n")
print("I sure hope you're doing okay now...have a great night!")
